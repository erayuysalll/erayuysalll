### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! My name is Eray, and I would like to introduce myself here on my GitHub profile.

I am a computer programmer and am passionate about software development. As Eray, I stepped into the world of coding to bring creative ideas to life, solve problems and improve user experience. I love doing research and learning about new technologies to adapt to the ever-evolving nature of the IT world.

My skills and experience in the field of information technologies have developed by working on various projects and using different languages. I enjoy working with the programming language [HTML, CSS, Java] the most and I am constantly trying to improve myself in this field. Also, I can use different languages â€‹â€‹and tools like [Adobe UI,Photoshop].

On my GitHub profile, I share the projects I'm working on and I'm here to share, get feedback and collaborate on these projects with other people. Interacting with open source communities and contributing to projects is of great importance to me during the software development process. I'm really excited when I can help others improve their software skills and produce something together.

I suggest you visit my GitHub profile to learn more about me and browse my projects. If you want to collaborate on a project or ask any questions, you can contact me via e-mail. I am always excited to collaborate and meet new people.

Thank you and welcome to visit my profile!
